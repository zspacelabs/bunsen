//! # Parakeet TDT
//!
//! NVIDIA's Parakeet TDT speech recognizer: a `FastConformer` encoder and a
//! token-and-duration transducer. `parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3` is the reference
//! checkpoint; `FermionResearch`'s Phonon-2 is a re-quantized derivative with
//! the same architecture.
//!
//! - [`blocks`]: the model, [`ParakeetTdt`], built from a
//!   [`ParakeetTdtConfig`]; its encoder is the shared
//!   [`ConformerEncoder`](crate::blocks::conformer::ConformerEncoder).
//! - [`ParakeetFrontEnd`]: the feature extractor, waveforms to normalized
//!   log-mels, built from a [`ParakeetFrontEndConfig`].
//! - [`weights`] (feature `store`): loading tensors named as `transformers`'
//!   `ParakeetForTDT` state dict, the names every Parakeet checkpoint format
//!   here is read under.
